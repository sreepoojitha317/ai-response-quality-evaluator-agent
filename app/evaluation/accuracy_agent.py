def evaluate_accuracy(question, ai_response, reference):
    """
    Evaluates the factual accuracy of an AI response.
    """

    evaluation_task = """
Evaluate ONLY the factual accuracy of the AI response.

Compare the AI response with the reference answer or retrieved context.

Scoring Rubric:

10 = Completely accurate. Every fact matches the reference.

8-9 = Mostly accurate. Contains only very minor factual mistakes or wording issues.

6-7 = Generally accurate but misses one or two important facts OR contains one moderate factual mistake.

4-5 = Partially accurate. Some information is correct but several facts are incorrect or missing.

2-3 = Mostly inaccurate. Only a small part of the response is factually correct.

1 = Almost completely incorrect.

0 = Completely incorrect or directly contradicts the reference.

Evaluation Rules:

• Evaluate ONLY factual accuracy.
• Ignore grammar and writing style.
• Ignore completeness.
• Ignore relevance.
• Penalize factual mistakes according to their severity.
• Use intermediate scores (2-9) whenever appropriate.
• Give 10 ONLY if every important fact is correct.
• Give 0 ONLY if the response is completely wrong or contradicts the reference.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:

{
    "score": <0-10>,
    "reason": "<brief explanation>",
    "evidence": "<supporting evidence>",
    "status": "<PASS or FAIL>"
