def evaluate_relevance(question, ai_response, reference):
    """
    Evaluates how relevant the AI response is to the given question.
    """

    evaluation_task = """
Evaluate ONLY the relevance of the AI response to the given question.

Determine whether the response actually answers the user's question.

Scoring Rubric:

10 = Perfectly relevant. Directly answers the question.

8-9 = Mostly relevant. Answers the question with only minor unnecessary information.

6-7 = Generally relevant but partially addresses the question or includes noticeable irrelevant content.

4-5 = Somewhat relevant. Only part of the response relates to the question.

2-3 = Mostly irrelevant. Very little of the response answers the question.

1 = Almost completely irrelevant.

0 = Completely unrelated to the question.

Evaluation Rules:

• Evaluate ONLY relevance.
• Ignore factual correctness.
• Ignore grammar.
• Ignore completeness.
• Ignore hallucinations.
• Focus only on whether the response addresses the user's question.
• Use intermediate scores whenever appropriate.
• Give 10 only if the response is fully relevant.
• Give 0 only if the response is completely unrelated.
• If the AI response matches the reference answer exactly, assign a relevance score of 10.
• Short answers (one word or one sentence) are acceptable if they correctly answer the question.
• Do not penalize responses for being brief.
• If the response directly answers the question, give 10 even if no extra explanation is provided.
IMPORTANT:

Return ONLY valid JSON.

Do NOT write explanations outside JSON.

Do NOT use markdown.

Return EXACTLY this format:

{
    "score": 0,
    "reason": "",
    "evidence": "",
    "status": ""
}
